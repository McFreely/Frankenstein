# Frankenstein Framework (WIP)

## About
This is a simple framework i put together in a couple of hours, mixing [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com), [typeplate](http://typeplate.com/), and a bit of other pieces of code i frequently use.

I love skeleton for it lightness.
I love Typeplate because i don't have to think about everything typography every new project.
I wanted to add Flat UI to it, and took a bit of inspiration from it for a few elements, but i will wait for the dust to settle on this.

## List of things I want to do

SASSify the skeleton part.
Work out a few kinks of the skeleton grib for mobile (work on Iphone, not so well on android)

## Disclaimer

This is a personnal project.
I did not create neither skeleton or typeplate.
