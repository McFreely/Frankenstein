# Frankenstein Framework (WIP)

## About
This is a simple framework I put together in a couple of hours, mixing [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com), [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/), and a bit of other pieces of code I frequently use.

I love skeleton for it lightness.
I love Typeplate because I don't have to think about everything typography every new project.
I wanted to add Flat UI to it, and took a bit of inspiration from it for a few elements, but I will wait for the dust to settle on this.

## List of things I want to do

- [] SASSify the skeleton part
- [] Work out a few kinks of the skeleton grib for mobile (work on Iphone, not so well on android)

## Disclaimer

This is a personnal project.
I did not create neither Skeleton or Typeplate.
